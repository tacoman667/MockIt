This project is mainly my way of enhancing my automated testing experience both from blogs I read and my own crazy thoughts.

Right now Testable<T> will only work for constructor based dependancy injection patterns as well as with property injection.

The BDDStyleTestingMethodExtensions class is really just trying to wrap asserts into more of a meaningful way so that while testing I can do things like:
result.ShouldNotBeNull();
or
result.Count.ShouldEqual(4);
